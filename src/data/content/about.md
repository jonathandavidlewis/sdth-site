  <p>
    Claude Jones has a passion for creating opportunities for others to
    succeed. This passion was shaped by the adversities he faced in his
    youth. Not knowing his birth father, Claude was raised by his mother
    and step-father. His upbringing was harsh, both of his parents worked
    so he was responsible for taking care of his 3 younger siblings, he
    faced verbal and physical abuse at home and racism in his community.
    Feeling like the weight of the world was on his shoulders, he would
    constantly wonder if the world would be a better place without him in
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When all hope seemed lost, things changed in the Spring of 1989. A
    school counselor noticed something in Claude. He pulled him in,
    created a supportive environment, encouraged him to believe in
    himself, and provided a structure and example of setting and achieve
    goals. This transformative act of acknowledgment set the tone for
    Claude and helped shape who he is today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on his personal experiences, Claude's philosophy in life is
    "perseverance will help you overcome all obstacles". From a young age
    Claude has been paving his own way, overcoming obstacles with the help
    of mentors and coaches. From starting his first business at age 12 to
    raise money for a video game console, to being a self-taught
    developer, his personal motivation to better himself created
    opportunities for him to take advantage of various situations. And
    through his blessings he would like to pay it forward by creating
    opportunities for others that might need a helping hand.

aboutTitle: "San Diego Tech Hub"
aboutDescription: >-

  Is San Diego a tech hub?  That was the question I asked on Thursday, December 6th, 2018 to a small group of passionate professionals looking to make a difference in the San Diego tech community.  As the discussion concluded, we realized we were missing a unified tech front.  We agreed San Diego had some “tech hubbing” going on across Downtown, Sorrento Valley, and North County, however, these tech communities were operating in a silo.  This begged the question, “what could be accomplished if we **ALL** worked together?”.


  That thought sparked a movement towards change -- Was it possible to bring the San Diego tech community together for the betterment of businesses, organizations, and individuals with the common goal of changing the perception of what it means to be a tech hub for San Diego?


  We had our mission -- Be conduits for change, by helping to build a stronger San Diego tech community through collaboration.  Our goal is not to duplicate efforts, but rather bridge gaps and encourage connections to drive transformative change across the tech community within San Diego.


  **We are Conduits.  We are Change.  We are San Diego.**
